## Target pipeline
```text
image ──► OCR signal   (RapidOCR + fuzzy brand-term match)      ─┐
      ──► SIFT signal  (keypoints + Lowe ratio + RANSAC verify) ─┤► rule-based decision ──► positive / review / negative
      ──► [conditional] region proposals + embedding similarity ─┤        │
      ──► [conditional] fine-tuned nano detector                ─┘        ▼
                                                              results.csv/json, crops/, detected/, review/
```

## Key principles
- Decision engine uses **OR rules**, not weighted averages: one strong signal ⇒ positive; a lone medium signal ⇒ review. Protects recall.
- Thresholds come from **calibration on the labeled set**, never intuition. Bands: positive / review / negative.
- Signals are independent modules returning `SignalResult(score, bbox, method, detail)` so the decision layer stays pluggable.
- CPU-first. Performance work only if measured ETA for 10k images exceeds ~12 h (then: multiprocessing before any GPU runtime).

## Data flow & artifacts
`input/` → scanner walk → per-image signals → decision → incremental `output/results.csv` + `output/.progress.jsonl` (resume) → final `results.json` summary + `crops/`, `detected/`, `review/`.
